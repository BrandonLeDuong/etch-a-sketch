## Introduction

The Etch-a-Sketch project simulates the classic drawing toy in a web browser. Users can draw by moving their mouse over a grid and can clear the drawing with a button click.


## Features

- **Draw on a Grid:** Move the mouse over the grid to draw.
- **Change Grid Size:** Dynamically adjust the grid size to create more detailed or simpler drawings.
- **Clear Drawing:** Clear the entire drawing with a single button click.
- **Toggle Grid Lines:** Show or hide the grid lines to suit your preference.
- **Color Picker:** Select custom colors for drawing. Choose any color from the color picker to draw with your preferred color.
- **Rainbow Mode:** Draw with random colors. When rainbow mode is enabled, each stroke will have a different random color, adding a fun and vibrant look to your drawings.
